# Development

## Coding style

DTCC Platform uses the coding style native to each language or domain.
This means, e.g., following the
[Style Guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/)
for Python code, the
[C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)
for C++ code, and the
[Google JSON Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsoncstyleguide.xml)
for JSON.

The following table summarizes the naming conventions used for DTCC
Platform.

|          | Python         | C++            | JavaScript    |
|----------|----------------|----------------|---------------|
| variable | `snake_case`   | `snake_case`   | `camelCase`   |
| function | `snake_case()` | `snake_case()` | `camelCase()` |
| class    | `PascalCase`   | `PascalCase`   | `CamelCase`   |
| module   | `snake_case`   |                |               |

In addition to this, DTCC Platform uses `kebab-case` for API endpoints
and `camelCase` for JSON.

## Git practices

DTCC Platform uses the following Git practices:

* The main (release) branch for each repository is named `main`.
* The development branch for each repository is named `develop`.
* All work should take place in separate branches (not directly in `develop` and certainly not in `main`).
* Branches for development (new features) should be named `dev/branch_name` where `branch_name` is a free form descriptive name.
* Branches for fixes (bugs, small things) should be named `fix/branch_name` where `branch_name` is a free form descriptive name.
* When the work is done, make a pull request for merging the branch into `develop`.
* When the work has been merged, the branch should be deleted to keep things tidy.
* When making a release, `develop` is merged into `main` and a release is made from `main`.

## Tips & tricks

### Using Git submodules

When cloning a repository that may contain submodules, use

    git clone --recursive <url>

If you have already cloned a repository and want to load all submodules, use

    git submodule update --init

### Remote development

Remote development is an alternative to local development (building
and running on the host system) and also an alternative to local
development in Docker containers (building and running inside a local
Docker container). The main idea is to build and run on a remote
system, either through an IDE (like Visual Studio Code) or in a
terminal using SSH. Below follows some simple steps for setting up
remote development using SSH on a Mac.

First, install macFUSE needed for mounting remote filesystems via SSH:

    brew install --cask macfuse

Then, mount the desired remote directory using the `sshfs` command,
something like this:

    sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions logg@compute.dtcc.chalmers.se:/scratch/logg /Users/logg/scratch/compute

For simplicity, this can be put in a little script named
`mount-compute` stored on the local machine:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    USER=logg
    SERVER=compute.dtcc.chalmers.se
    LOCAL=/Users/logg/scratch/compute
    REMOTE=compute/scratch/logg
    sshfs -o allow_other,default_permissions $USER@$SERVER:$REMOTE $LOCAL

Note that this should *not* be run as root (using `sudo`) since this
will give you problems with permissions (not able to write files). Also
note that you should not use `~` in the paths since this might be
expanded in the shell and confuse `sshfs` (causing it to hang by
setting up some circular mounting). Instead, full absolute paths
should be used.

The corresponding script for unmounting the remote directory is
`umount-compute`:

    #!/usr/bin/env bash
    LOCAL=/Users/logg/scratch/compute
    umount $LOCAL

Or just run the `umount` command on the directory.

Once the remote directory has been mounted, the remote directory is
available on the local system. Fire up your editor on the local system
to edit source files and do everything else in one or more terminals
to the remote system: `git`, `cmake`, `make` etc.
